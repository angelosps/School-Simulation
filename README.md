# :school: School Simulation

This project is about simulating a school building.  

A school building constist of the following:  
* a yard
* a stair
* three floors  

Each of the three floors consists of:
* a corridor
* six classrooms

So, we can organize the various spaces as follows:  
```bash
School
  |__ Yard
  |__ Stair
  |__ Floor1
  |     |__ Corridor
  |     |__ Classroom1
  |     |__ Classroom2
  |     |__ Classroom3
  |     |__ Classroom4
  |     |__ Classroom5
  |     |__ Classroom6
  |__ Floor2
  |     |__ Corridor
  |     |__ Classroom1
  |     |__ Classroom2
  |     |__ Classroom3
  |     |__ Classroom4
  |     |__ Classroom5
  |     |__ Classroom6
  |__ Floor3
        |__ Corridor
        |__ Classroom1
        |__ Classroom2
        |__ Classroom3
        |__ Classroom4
        |__ Classroom5
        |__ Classroom6
  
```
